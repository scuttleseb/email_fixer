# email_fixer
Nothing fancy just a straightforward utility app (in case I need it again) which simply automates the job of extracting email addresses from a messy text file.

Motivated by the fact that I had to manually combine two messy lists of email addresses, extract the actual email addresses, sort and de-dupe them into one distribution list - just so I could send an email to the said list.
